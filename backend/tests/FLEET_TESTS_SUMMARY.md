## Coverage Areas

### Services Tested
1. ✅ Vehicle Management
2. ✅ Trip Logs
3. ✅ Fuel Control
4. ✅ Maintenance (Preventive & Corrective)
5. ✅ TCO Calculation

### API Endpoints Tested
- `POST /api/fleet/vehicles` - Create vehicle
- `GET /api/fleet/vehicles` - List vehicles
- `GET /api/fleet/vehicles/:id` - Get vehicle
- `PUT /api/fleet/vehicles/:id` - Update vehicle
- `POST /api/fleet/trip-logs` - Create trip log
- `PUT /api/fleet/trip-logs/:id/finalize` - Finalize trip
- `POST /api/fleet/fuel-controls` - Create fuel control
- `GET /api/fleet/fuel-controls/statistics` - Fuel statistics
- `POST /api/fleet/maintenances` - Create maintenance
- `PUT /api/fleet/maintenances/:id/complete` - Complete maintenance
- `GET /api/fleet/maintenances/upcoming` - Upcoming maintenances
- `GET /api/fleet/tco/vehicle/:id` - Vehicle TCO
- `GET /api/fleet/tco/fleet` - Fleet TCO
- `GET /api/fleet/statistics` - Fleet statistics

### Key Features Tested
- ✅ CRUD operations for all entities
- ✅ Data validation and error handling
- ✅ Business logic (efficiency calculation, TCO, etc.)
- ✅ Automatic calculations (distance, costs, next maintenance)
- ✅ Filtering and pagination
- ✅ Statistics and reporting
- ✅ Authorization and authentication
- ✅ Duplicate detection (codes, plates, vouchers)
- ✅ Cascading operations (trip finalization updates vehicle mileage)
- ✅ Preventive maintenance scheduling

## Running Tests

### Run All Fleet Tests
```bash
npm test -- fleet
```

### Run Unit Tests Only
```bash
npm test -- tests/unit/fleet
```

### Run Integration Tests Only
```bash
npm test -- tests/integration/fleet.integration.test.js
```

### Run with Coverage
```bash
npm test -- --coverage fleet
```

## Expected Coverage
- **Target**: >70% coverage
- **Lines**: Expected >75%
- **Functions**: Expected >80%
- **Branches**: Expected >70%

## Test Data Cleanup
All integration tests include proper cleanup in `afterAll` hooks to prevent test data pollution.

## Notes
- Tests use mocked Prisma client for unit tests
- Integration tests use real database with test data
- All tests are independent and can run in any order
- Authentication is handled via test user credentials
